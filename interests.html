					Writing
				</div>
				I enjoy creative writing a lot, with the theme I gravitate towards the most being people finding themselves in unfamiliar places, amongst unfamiliar beings, and having to adapt, most often by realizing that not everyone is out to get them, and that they can finally lower their guard.	
			</div>

			<div class="para">
				My main writing projects are:

				<ul class="clear">
					<li><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/33880342">Another Way (ongoing)</a></b> - Pokémon fanfiction | After waking up in an alien body she has no control over, Sue must persevere in a world that eludes her understanding, its monstrous inhabitants as secretive as they are kind. Finding herself stranded with no knowledge of either the locals or their language, and no recollection of how her ordinary trip ended up here, she has only one goal now- to survive and make it home.</li>
					<li><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/43084872">From the Vast (ongoing)</a></b> - Pokémon fanfiction | In a remote corner of Unova, a village of Pokémon hides from the omnipresent humanity and the barbarity it brings with itself, flourishing through cooperation and rising above the uncaring brutality of the natural order. Which works remarkably well... ...until a half dead human shows up on their doorstep.</li>
					<li><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/44629189">Welcome Home (finished)</a></b> - Original Story | Riley, a human orphan with a rough background, is adopted by the Ashers, a family of skunk anthros, all of them learning a lesson on what it truly means to be a family and to overcome differences.</li>			
				</ul>

					Coding
				</div>
				Over the years, I've put together a couple neat utilities for videogames I play, as well as a couple mods, with almost all art assets being made by myself.

				<ul>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/HATE">HATE</a></b> - The original asset scrambling program for Undertale.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/Undefined_3.0">Undefined 3.0</a></b> - An asset scrambling program for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, featured on Vinesauce.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/xxhash_cpp">xxhash_cpp</a></b> - C++ port of the xxhash hashing library.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/StadiumGaming/PvPokeGMPatchTool">Grumpig</a></b> - Tool for applying patches to the gamemaster file used by <a href="https://pvpoke.com">pvpoke.com</a>.</li>

					Pokemens
				</div>
				I'm a big fan of the Pokémon franchise and especially setting, though mostly because of what it could be rather than what it currently is. 
				I play Pokémon GO at a semicompetitive level (yes, it has a competitive scene!), reached Legend thrice, <a href="https://sil.ph/redspah">ended Silph Season 4 at global rank #109</a>, and I'm a big fan of limited formats.

				I'm also a contributing writer and meta analyst for <a href="https://www.stadiumgaming.gg">GOStadium</a>.
