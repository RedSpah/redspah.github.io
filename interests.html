					Writing
				</div>
				I enjoy creative writing a lot, with the theme I gravitate towards the most being people finding themselves in unfamiliar places, amongst unfamiliar beings, and having to adapt, most often by realizing that not everyone is out to get them, and that they can finally lower their guard.	
			</div>

			<div class="para">
				My main writing projects are:

				<ul class="clear">
					<li><b><a href="https://www.wattpad.com/story/200878643-welcome-home">Welcome Home (finished)</a></b> - Original Story | Riley, a human orphan with a rough background, is adopted by the Ashers, a family of skunk anthros, all of them learning a lesson on what it truly means to be a family and to overcome differences.</li>
					<li><b><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/33880342/chapters/84238783">Another Way (ongoing)</a></b> - Pokémon fanfiction | An unsuspecting college student wakes up in an alien body, finding herself in an increasingly mystifying place that seems to elude her understanding, with no recollection of how her run of the mill forest trip ended up there, but instead a clear goal- survival and making it home.</li>
				</ul>

					Coding
				</div>
				Over the years, I've put together a couple neat utilities for videogames I play, as well as a couple mods, with almost all art assets being made by myself.

				<ul>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/HATE">HATE</a></b> - The original asset scrambling program for Undertale.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/Undefined_3.0">Undefined 3.0</a></b> - An asset scrambling program for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, featured on Vinesauce.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/RedSpah/xxhash_cpp">xxhash_cpp</a></b> - C++ port of the xxhash hashing library.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://github.com/StadiumGaming/PvPokeGMPatchTool">Grumpig</a></b> - Tool for applying patches to the gamemaster file used by <a href="https://pvpoke.com">pvpoke.com</a>.</li>
					<li><b  class="clear" ><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2520973701">Astra Mod</a></b> - Mod for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, featuring art assets made by yours truly, written in <a href="https://isaacscript.github.io">IsaacScript</a>.</li>

					Pokemens
				</div>
				I'm a big fan of the Pokémon franchise and especially setting, though mostly because of what it could be rather than what it currently is. 
				I play Pokémon GO at a semicompetitive level (yes, it has a competitive scene!), reached Legend thrice, <a href="https://sil.ph/redspah">ended Silph Season 4 at global rank #109</a>, and I'm a big fan of limited formats.		
			
				Once Scarlet/Violet (first Main Series Game I'm gonna play on release) drops, I plan to try picking up VGC as well.
